# Office Table Tennis
An App to create Office Leagues and Tournmanets for Table Tennis. 

## MVP 1
In the First iteration the app should:
- Make it possible for users to register and perform simple tasks such as updating their display name. 
- Have "friends".
- Possible to create leagues, and adminitrate stuff like number of games, players, etc. 
- Send league invites, and join.
- Register matches in leagues. 
- Register standalone matches.

## App Achitecture
I will use firestore as the DB.
I will write the backend in Node JS Express. 
The frontend will be written in Angular.
